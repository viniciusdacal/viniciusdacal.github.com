My name is Vinicius Dacal, I am 21 years old and I am Bachelor of Technology in Internet Systems.

I make websites for fun since I was 14, when I took a course in web design.
When I was 18, I started working at ADN MÃºltipla, where I have dedicated myself to front-end development and mobile development.

I'm also proud of some projects like Pure CSS3 Bender Futurama](https://github.com/viniciusdacal/bender-css3) e [Pure CSS3 Iron Man Marvel](https://github.com/viniciusdacal/ironman)

I believe I have much to learn and I think this is the best of life, always have something to learn and something to perfecting.

I treat every difficulty as a challenge, it makes everything easier and fun.
