Last Saturday I was in Sao Paulo for the React Conf BR. I was very excited about this event, and I had been planning this travel for some months. That was going to be the first edition and actually, that was going to be the first time we had a React Conf in Latin America, so I believe I wasn’t the only one excited about that. So, I would like to share my main impressions about each talk and the conf itself.

### The magic world of tests with Jest

The conference was opened by [Fernando Daciuk](https://medium.com/u/56a528c3eb78) talking about TDD and Jest. Daciuk is an experienced developer and his didactic is excellent. More than just showing what we are used to see about TDD, he talked about the importance of tests to document our code and our functionalities and he also guided us through a baby step test case using _Jest_.

### Transforming a legacy frontend in a React Application

This talk was presented by [Kete Martins Rufino](https://medium.com/u/22305afc282d) and [Christiano Milfont](https://medium.com/u/a8dc8aafba41). They brought us some approaches they were using to migrate a Backbone application to React and Redux. They shared the difficulties they had in the process and how they solved them. This talk was really interesting, because it made clear that we don’t need to be attached to an specific technology just because we have a legacy application. There are sometimes where you don’t find a made solution and you end up creating your own, but there are always ways to keep evolving the projects. Their presentation’s slides can be found here: [goo.gl/6g3bFc](https://t.co/J6gId718yC "https://goo.gl/6g3bFc")

We are here now at @ReactConfBR! Let’s esteem the brazilian conferences! May we have more events of this level.

### Let’s dive into Babel: How everything works

[Marcelo Camargo](https://medium.com/u/f8c552d9732b) is the creator of [_Quack lang_](https://github.com/haskellcamargo/quack) and he has a comprehensive knowledge about compilers and functional programming. He introduced us to Babel’s internals and how Babel handles the JSX parsing. He also showed how we could use Babel plugins to create custom functionalities to a programming language.

**Be aware:** One of the slides contains a prank, so, better you turn your **sound off** before going trough them. The presentation slides can be found here: [https://goo.gl/7rvKTG](https://goo.gl/7rvKTG)

### Statically Typing your GraphQL App

Those were all the presentations for the morning. Right after them, we had a Fishbowl time, where some people stay sit in chairs on the stage, asking question to others. Anyone who wants to ask some question, or answer, could go to the stage an take a chair. The main rule was: One of the chair should be always empty, to give space to others.

### MobX: The light side of the force

Back from lunch, the first talk was given by [Clara Battesini](https://medium.com/u/215ea10e0f94). She is a Frontend developer and a Computer Engineering student. She introduced us to [_MobX_](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx), a state manager that can be an alternative to Redux.

### What React has about Functional

In this amazing presentation, [Matheus Lima](https://medium.com/u/fb33cb80b669) talked about how functional programming influenced on React’s development, through pure functions, immutability and composition, and how we could use more those concepts to write declarative code and simplify our component logics. The slides for this presentation are in pt-br and can be found here: [https://goo.gl/qfFD4G](https://goo.gl/qfFD4G)

### React Performance from Scratch

[Keulelr Magalhaes](https://medium.com/u/fc3b127ad50a), Software Engineer at PagSeguro, talked about performance measurement and showed us how he did some benchmarks, comparing _React_, [_InfernoJS_](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno) and [_Preact_](https://github.com/developit/preact)_._

Notice that GraphQL was the buzzword during the conference. All the cases of success made me feel motivated to invest some time on it.

I almost forgot to mention, everyone won a cardboard VR glasses kit, which was so cool.

To close the day, the english school [An English Thing](http://www.anenglishthing.com.br/) sponsored an afterparty with free drinks.

The event was really great and connected a lot of people. Congrats for all the speakers to been share their knowledge and specially the organizers to show that we have an awesome React community here in Brazil.
